#Pixel Picker

## About

Pixel Picker is a full stack application that allows users to generate a group of five colors generated via hex code. Individual colors can be locked in and randomization repeated until a desireable palette is found. Palettes can then be saved into individual projects, recalled later, and deleted.

All data for this application is stored in a custom backend database built using Express, PostgreSQL, and Knex utilizing REST API.

Pixel Picker is deployed to Heroku and can be found [here](https://pixel-picker.herokuapp.com).

This project is a part of the Front End Engineering program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](www.turing.io). Project specs can be found here. This project was built in its entirety by Kevin Simpson.
